# time-lapse-creator

This is simple program to generate time lapse video.

I'm going to improve this project and I will describe it in my [blog](https://zielony-backlog.pl) (unfortunately in Polish but maybe in future... Who knows...)

I met `org.bytedeco:javacv` on the Internet accidentally, and I think it is very interesting project. I'd like to use is. However, I faced an issue, and I hope the community of `javacv` will help me.
